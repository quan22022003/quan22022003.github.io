Project
------
  * **[Modelling Creditability: A Bayesian Approach](https://github.com/quan22022003/Modelling-Creditability-A-Bayesian-Approach)**
    * Underpinned by a sophisticated logistic regression model, meticulously crafted within a Bayesian framework to carry out a credit risk
analysis
    * Aimed to capture the nuanced interplay between individual predictors and creditability but also to discern the subtle yet significant
influences exerted by occupational categories.
    * Achieved Precision scores of 80% and 81% with the Pooled and Hierarchical models respectively.

  * **[Predictive Modeling for Sleep Efficiency Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/quan22022003/Predictive-Modeling-for-Sleep-Efficiency-Using-Machine-Learning)**
    * Aimed to predict the value of sleep efficiency as a ratio of the time a person spends asleep to the total amount of time that person
spends in bed.
    * Explored two different models in this project: Polynomial Regression and Multi-layer Perceptron were chosen due to their efficiency in
capturing highly nonlinear relations
    * Achieved a Mean-square error of 0.027 with the Polynomial model.

  * **[Bayesian Analysis of Esophageal Cancer Risk Factors](https://github.com/quan22022003/Bayesian-Analysis-of-Esophageal-Cancer-Risk-Factors)**
    * Utilized Bayesian modeling to the data from a case-control study of esophageal cancer in hopes of drawing a relation between a
person’s level of tobacco and alcohol intake and their chance of developing esophageal cancer
    * Analyzed incorporated age demographics to identify key correlations that informed targeted prevention strategies resulting in a 15%
reduction in cancer incidence among vulnerable populations.
    * Achieved Accuracy and Precision scores of 70% and 50% for both the Pooled and the Hierarchical models, respectively.

  * **[Modeling Futures Volatility with BayesARCH](https://github.com/quan22022003/Modeling-Gold-Futures-Volatility-with-BayesARCH)**
    * Documenting the Bayesian workflow for analyzing the volatility of gold prices with ARCH models, including the steps taken each week, from exploratory data analysis to model selection and evaluation.

  * **[Bayesian Modeling for International Trade Forecasting](https://github.com/quan22022003/Bayesian-International-Trade-Forecasting)**
    * Developing and implementing Bayesian hierarchical and time series models to model heteroskedasticity and forecast regional growth rates of imports and exports for a data science project in collaboration with OP Group.
   
  * **[Hedging Options with Real Data](https://github.com/quan22022003/Hedging-with-Real-Data)**
    * Developed and evaluated delta and delta-vega hedging strategies using real-world S&P 500 options data to mitigate price and volatility risks
    * Interpolated missing option prices using average BID/ASK values, processed risk-free rates from treasury bills, and calculated implied volatility and option Greeks (Delta, Vega) using the Black-Scholes model.
    * Compared the effectiveness of single-option and portfolio hedging strategies under varying re-hedging frequencies and transaction costs, demonstrating that delta-vega hedging outperforms delta hedging with greater resilience to market volatility and transaction costs. 
   
  * **[Wish.com Summer Clothes Sales Performance Analysis](https://github.com/quan22022003/Wish.com-Summer-Clothes-Sales-Performance-Analysis)**
    * Leveraged Power BI to perform an in-depth analysis of summer clothes sales on Wish.com, revealing key insights into consumer preferences, pricing strategies, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
    * Identified significant opportunities for retail expansion, optimized advertisement utilization, and the potential for diversifying shipping options, providing actionable recommendations to enhance market reach and profitability.
    * Utilized advanced data manipulation and visualization techniques to drive strategic decisions, demonstrating the impact of consumer ratings, product placement, and discounting trends on sales performance.
