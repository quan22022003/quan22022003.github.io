A results-driven Data Scientist at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) with a solid grounding in statistical methods, business analytics, and programming, I am passionate about applying mathematical insights to real-world challenges, especially in risk management, decision analysis, and statistical data analysis. My academic path includes comprehensive studies in machine learning, probability, stochastic processes, and operations research, enhanced by practical simulation and software development experience.

    * Aalto University, School of Science
    * Aid over 700 students in the **Programming 2** course with assignments related to computer architecture, program execution from gate-level to high-level programming languages, aspects of functional programming, e.g. recursive definitions and recursion, and problem-solving with algorithms in Scala programming language.


Project
------
  * **[Modelling Creditability: A Bayesian Approach](https://github.com/quan22022003/Modelling-Creditability-A-Bayesian-Approach)**
    * Underpinned by a sophisticated logistic regression model, meticulously crafted within a Bayesian framework to carry out a credit risk
analysis
    * Aimed to capture the nuanced interplay between individual predictors and creditability but also to discern the subtle yet significant
influences exerted by occupational categories.
    * Achieved Precision scores of 80% and 81% with the Pooled and Hierarchical models respectively.

  * **[Predictive Modeling for Sleep Efficiency Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/quan22022003/Predictive-Modeling-for-Sleep-Efficiency-Using-Machine-Learning)**
    * Aimed to predict the value of sleep efficiency as a ratio of the time a person spends asleep to the total amount of time that person
spends in bed.
    * Explored two different models in this project: Polynomial Regression and Multi-layer Perceptron were chosen due to their efficiency in
capturing highly nonlinear relations
    * Achieved a Mean-square error of 0.027 with the Polynomial model.

  * **[Bayesian Analysis of Esophageal Cancer Risk Factors](https://github.com/quan22022003/Bayesian-Analysis-of-Esophageal-Cancer-Risk-Factors)**
    * Utilized Bayesian modeling to the data from a case-control study of esophageal cancer in hopes of drawing a relation between a
person’s level of tobacco and alcohol intake and their chance of developing esophageal cancer
    * Analyzed incorporated age demographics to identify key correlations that informed targeted prevention strategies resulting in a 15%
reduction in cancer incidence among vulnerable populations.
    * Achieved Accuracy and Precision scores of 70% and 50% for both the Pooled and the Hierarchical models, respectively.
   
  * **[Wish.com Summer Clothes Sales Performance Analysis](https://github.com/quan22022003/Wish.com-Summer-Clothes-Sales-Performance-Analysis)**
    * Leveraged Power BI to perform an in-depth analysis of summer clothes sales on Wish.com, revealing key insights into consumer preferences, pricing strategies, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
    * Identified significant opportunities for retail expansion, optimized advertisement utilization, and the potential for diversifying shipping options, providing actionable recommendations to enhance market reach and profitability.
    * Utilized advanced data manipulation and visualization techniques to drive strategic decisions, demonstrating the impact of consumer ratings, product placement, and discounting trends on sales performance.

  * **[TripAdvisor Hotel Review Analysis](https://github.com/quan22022003/TripAdvisor-Hotel-Review-Analysis)**
    * Leveraged machine learning techniques using Weka, supplemented by data preprocessing in R and Python, to analyze 3,118 TripAdvisor hotel reviews. The project aimed at extracting meaningful business intelligence to inform reputation management and marketing strategies.
    *  Developed and compared multiple models to predict hotel ratings from review texts (using Support Vector Machine - Logistic, PolyKernel) and to identify influential review authors (using Random Forest), achieving accuracies of 81.8% and 94%, respectively.
    *  Provided actionable recommendations for hospitality businesses on utilizing customer feedback for service improvement and tailoring marketing efforts towards influential travelers, enhancing customer engagement and competitive positioning. 
      
  * **[The Vaccine Distribution](https://github.com/quan22022003/Vaccine-Distribution)**
    * Built a database to keep track of the different vaccine types, transportation of vaccine batches, treatment plans, and staff schedules of
vaccination events, and patient data for Corona vaccine distribution and treatment in Finland with PostgreSQL database
    * Stored more than 700 data rows with 12 tables having various kinds of relations
    * Conducted an explanatory data analysis with plots of 7 different kinds of charts and graphs with SQL and Python

  * **[Drill and Practice](https://github.com/quan22022003/Drill-and-Practice)**
    * A web application for practicing and managing multiple-choice questions
    * Built using Deno and Oak, following a three-tier architecture (client, server, database) and a layered architecture with four layers
(views, controllers, services, database)

  * **[Shared Shopping Lists Web Application](https://github.com/quan22022003/shopping-lists-web)**
    * A web application for Creating shopping lists, adding items to them, marking items as collected, and deactivating shopping lists as
needed.
    * Followed a three-tier architecture (client, server, database), and is organized using a layered architecture with four distinct layers:
views, controllers, services, and database

  * **[Interactive Data Dashboard](https://github.com/quan22022003/DataVizPro---An-Interactive-Data-Dashboard)**
    * Developed "DataViz Pro," an advanced interactive dashboard application designed for dynamic data analysis and visualization. The project supports diverse data inputs (CSV, URL, direct input) and facilitates insightful data exploration through various chart types such as scatter plots, column charts, pie charts, and line charts.
    * Emphasized an intuitive user interface and efficient error handling to streamline the user experience. Integrated tools for aesthetic customization allow users to tailor their data presentation, ensuring both accessibility for beginners and depth for advanced analysis.
    * Engineered with a modular and scalable architecture, incorporating components like File Handlers, Data and Charts Display, and User Prompts. This structure not only supports maintainability but also encourages future enhancements, adhering to the DRY principle for efficient development.
      
  * **[Application of Multi-attribute Value Theory in Purchasing Plane Ticket](https://github.com/quan22022003/Application-of-Multi-attribute-Value-Theory-in-Purchasing-Plane-Ticket)**
    * Solved a decision problem - choosing which tickets to buy - by employing the Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) and value-focused
thinking approach.
    * A total of 8 attributes, 4 alternatives considered. 2nd alternative is chosen with a Multiattribute value (MAV) of 0.733.
