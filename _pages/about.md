A results-driven Data Scientist at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) with a solid grounding in statistical methods, business analytics, and programming, I am passionate about applying mathematical insights to real-world challenges, especially in risk management, decision analysis, and statistical data analysis. My academic path includes comprehensive studies in machine learning, probability, stochastic processes, and operations research, enhanced by practical simulation and software development experience.
