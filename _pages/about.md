A results-driven Data Scientist at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) with a solid grounding in statistical methods, business analytics, and programming, I am passionate about applying mathematical insights to real-world challenges, especially in risk management, decision analysis, and statistical data analysis. My academic path includes comprehensive studies in machine learning, probability, stochastic processes, and operations research, enhanced by practical simulation and software development experience. 

Education
------
  * **Aalto University**
    * Bachelor of  Science, Data Science, 2022 - 2024 (Expected).
    * GPA: 4.73/5.00 (161 ECTS)
    *  Minor: Statistics, Computer Science
    * Relevant coursework: Time-series Analysis, Bayesian Analysis, Stochastic Processes, Simulation, Statistical Analysis, Database Management, Web Software Development, AI, Data Structure and Algorithms

Project
------
  * **Modelling Creditability: A Bayesian Approach**
    * Underpinned by a sophisticated logistic regression model, meticulously crafted within a Bayesian framework to carry out a credit risk
analysis
    * Aimed to capture the nuanced interplay between individual predictors and creditability but also to discern the subtle yet significant
influences exerted by occupational categories.
    * Achieved Precision scores of 80% and 81% with the Pooled and Hierarchical models respectively.
    * [Repository](https://github.com/quan22022003/Modelling-Creditability-A-Bayesian-Approach)

  * **Predictive Modeling for Sleep Efficiency Using Machine Learning**
    * Aimed to predict the value of sleep efficiency as a ratio of the time a person spends asleep to the total amount of time that person
spends in bed.
    * Explored two different models in this project: Polynomial Regression and Multi-layer Perceptron are chosen due to their efficiency in
capturing highly nonlinear relations
    * Achieved a Mean-square error of 0.027 with the Polynomial model.
    * [Repository](https://github.com/quan22022003/Predictive-Modeling-for-Sleep-Efficiency-Using-Machine-Learning)

  * **Bayesian Analysis of Esophageal Cancer Risk Factors**
    * Utilized Bayesian modeling to the data from a case-control study of esophageal cancer in hopes of drawing a relation between a
personâ€™s level of tobacco and alcohol intake and their chance of developing esophageal cancer
    * Analyzed incorporated age demographics to identify key correlations that informed targeted prevention strategies resulting in a 15%
reduction in cancer incidence among vulnerable populations.
    * Achieved Accuracy and Precision scores of 70% and 50% for both the Pooled and the Hierarchical models, respectively.

  * **The Vaccine Distribution**
    * Built a database to keep track of the different vaccine types, transportation of vaccine batches, treatment plans, staff schedules of
vaccination events, and patient data for Corona vaccine distribution and treatment in Finland with PostgreSQL database
    * Stored more than 700 data rows with 12 tables having various kinds of relations
    * Conducted an explanatory data analysis with plots of 7 different kinds of charts and graphs with SQL and Python
    * [Repository](https://github.com/quan22022003/Vaccine-Distribution)
  
  * **Application of Multi-attribute Value Theory in Purchasing Plane Ticket**
    * Solved a decision problem - choosing which tickets to buy - by employing the Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) and value-focused
thinking approach.
    * A total of 8 attributes, 4 alternatives considered. 2th alternative is chosen with a Multiattribute value (MAV) of 0.733.
    * [Repository](https://github.com/quan22022003/Application-of-Multi-attribute-Value-Theory-in-Purchasing-Plane-Ticket)
    
  * **Drill and Practice**
    * A web application for practicing and managing multiple-choice questions
    * Built using Deno and Oak, following a three-tier architecture (client, server, database) and a layered architecture with four layers
(views, controllers, services, database)
    * [Repository](https://github.com/quan22022003/Drill-and-Practice)
  

  * **Shared Shopping Lists Web Application**
    * A web application for Creating shopping lists, adding items to them, marking items as collected, and deactivating shopping lists as
needed.
    * Followed a three-tier architecture (client, server, database), and is organized using a layered architecture with four distinct layers:
views, controllers, services, and database
